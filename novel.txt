I've opened myself up and am ready to examine and describe myself.

Next up:

Describe what we have line by line.
And within each line, proceed token by token,
describing whatever sequences of non-whitespace characters
are found there, separated, of course, by whitespace.
And within each token, describe each ASCII character.
ASCII characters are represented by bytes: eight bits.
Describe what eight bits are each character's one-byte representation.

Here we go...
